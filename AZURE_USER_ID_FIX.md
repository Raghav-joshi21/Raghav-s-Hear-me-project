# Azure Communication Services - User ID Format Fix

## 🔴 Error: "Invalid CommunicationUser identifier specified"

This error occurs when the user ID format is incorrect. Azure Communication Services requires user IDs in the format: `8:acs:<unique-id>`

## ✅ Solution

The backend now:
1. Properly extracts the user ID from Azure SDK's `create_user()` response
2. Returns it in the correct format
3. Provides a `/my-user-id` endpoint to get your own user ID

## 📋 How to Use

### Step 1: Get Your User ID
When you enter "Text / Gesture Mode", your user ID is automatically loaded and displayed in the controls panel.

### Step 2: Share Your User ID
Copy your user ID (shown in green box) and share it with the person you want to call.

### Step 3: Call Another User
Enter their user ID (must be in format `8:acs:...`) in the input field and click "Start Call".

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **User IDs must be in format `8:acs:...`** - not arbitrary text
- Each user gets a unique ID when they load the page
- You can only call users who have valid Azure Communication Services user IDs
- The user ID is generated by Azure's Identity SDK - you cannot make up your own

## 🔧 Backend Requirements

Make sure:
1. Backend is running: `cd backend && python main.py`
2. Azure SDK is installed: `pip install azure-communication-identity`
3. Connection string is correct in `backend/main.py`

## 🧪 Testing

1. Open the Communication page in two browser windows/tabs
2. Both will get their own user IDs
3. Copy one user ID and paste it in the other window
4. Click "Start Call" - it should work!
