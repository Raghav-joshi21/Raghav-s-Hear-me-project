# Quick Test Guide

## Step 1: Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python simple_test_api.py
```

Wait until you see: `🚀 Starting Simple Test API on http://localhost:8000`

## Step 2: Start Frontend (if not already running)

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Step 3: Open Test Page

In your browser, go to:

**http://localhost:5173/test_asl_api.html**

Or if the file is in `public/` folder:
- Just open: `http://localhost:5173/test_asl_api.html`

You should see buttons to test the API!

## If Still Not Working:

Try opening directly in browser:
1. Open Finder
2. Go to: `/Users/raghav/hear me webpage/public/`
3. Double-click `test_asl_api.html`
4. It will open in your browser directly
